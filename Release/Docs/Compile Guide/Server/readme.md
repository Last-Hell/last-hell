# Server Compiling

This Guide should work like a charme on CentOS 6.X tested on CentOS 6.10 it should also work with CentOS 7.X some Server code modifikation required mybe i'll add it some time!

boost version is 1.65.1 (don't go further without making code changes!!!)

This tutorial has been made 2022 changes could have been made since then I won't recheck!

for Creation use VMWare 15 or newer fallow the steps in Compile.txt and install everything as stated. It has been tested with gcc Version 4.4.7 which works quite well.

be sure to edit the makefile and change it to -j8 or whatever fits ur system if -j32 kills ur system.

hope it helps and have fun Playing LC
